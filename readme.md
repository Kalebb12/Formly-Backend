# Formly â€” Simple Form Builder ðŸš€

Formly is a backend for a simple form-builder app where users can create and share custom forms (contact, survey, feedback, etc.) and collect responses in their dashboard. This repository contains the API and auth logic for the MVP.


## MVP Concept
Users create and share forms and collect submissions. The backend supports:
- User authentication (signup/login)
- Public form URLs
- Viewing and downloading submissions
- Paid plan integration (Stripe) placeholder

## Core MVP features
- âœ… User authentication (signup, login, logout)
- âœ… Dashboard: create, edit, and delete forms (API scaffolding may be partial)
- âœ… Public form URLs (e.g., `formly.app/f/caleb-contact`)
- âœ… View and download submissions (may require additional work)
- âœ… Paid plan â†’ unlock more forms, analytics, and branding (Stripe referenced)
